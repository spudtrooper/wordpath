# wordpath

A word game where you try to connect words (scrabble-style) from a start square to and end square and avoid obstacles along the way. I'm certain this is going to be my ticket to fame and fortune.

See the [prototype](https://spudtrooper.github.io/wordpath)

An empty board currently looks like this:

A partial solution looks like this:
